The testers are run using JuitTestSuite.
Running the testers without the suite may lead to a failure test.
The failure occurs when running the class MarshallingTest without the suit.
Because it consists of stack trace which changes when we run the class itself rather than
then suite.

The project should be run using compiler compilance level 1.8

The needed JARs are attached in a dedicated directory in the project.
